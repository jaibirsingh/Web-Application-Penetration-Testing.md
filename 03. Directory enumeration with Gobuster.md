# Gobuster
* A command-line utility

* `gobuster dir --help`
* `gobuster dir -u [target IP] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`
* We can filter out the status 403 and 404. The folders which are not accessible are of no use to us.
* For that we can use the following command with the previous command:
  * `-b 403,404`
 
* For going after particular file formats:
  * `-x .php,.xml,.txt -r`
  * The -r flag stands for "follow redirects." When this flag is used, gobuster will follow HTTP redirects.
  * This means if the server responds with a redirect (like a 3xx HTTP status code, indicating that the requested resource has moved), gobuster will automatically follow that redirect and continue scanning the redirected location for directories and files.
