* Turn the Burp suite to a proxy through FoxyProxy
* Start the Burp suite --> This will show the cookie that we will use further.(PSESSID)
* Turn the "Intercept off" to login with the provided credentials to the target.
* Select" SQL Injection (GET/Search)"
* Start "Intercept" again.
* On the target, search "Joe". Then "forward" for the number of times it takes to go through.
* We should see this entry in Burp suite under "Proxy".

* Now in the terminal:
* `sqlmap`
* `sqlmap -u "[target_ip]/[copy the entry in the GET request]" --cookie "[Cookie's value from Burp suite]" -p title`
* This command should give the payloads that can be used to exploit the target
* Now in Burp suite:
* Right-click --> "Send to repeater" --> In "Repeater", paste one of the payload options given by the above command in GET section of the Repeater code.
* "Send"
* If this payload is blocked, it should give an Error on the right-side of the Burp suite.
* Try different payloads.
