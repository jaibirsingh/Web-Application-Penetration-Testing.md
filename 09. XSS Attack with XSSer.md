* Open the target in the browser and turn the Burp into a proxy using FoxyProxy.
* Enter some data in the text box on the web page to be caught by  Burp. We will use this script under "Proxy" in Burp later.
* In the terminal, we will start the cross-side scripter --> `xsser`
* Cross-site scripter is an automatic framework to detect, exploit and report XSS vulnerabilities in web-based applications.
* `xsser --url "http://[target IP]/[Request from the "POST" section in the code under "Proxy" tab]" -p "[payload = which is the last line of the code under "Proxy" tab, but instead of the text we passed from the website, we need to change the "target_host" variable's value to "XSS"]"`
* We can add --auto tag to the above command to try more payloads.
* Add to the above command: `--Fp "<script>alert(1)</script>"
* This would give the final attack payload which can be added to the bottom lin eof the code under "Proxy" section.
* "Forward" --> This should give the alert saying "1" on the web page.
